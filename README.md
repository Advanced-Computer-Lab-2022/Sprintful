# Sprintful
An Online Learning System through which individuals can attend pre-recorded
courses online that have been created and uploaded on the website by their instructors.

## Motivation
This project is part of **Advanced Computer Lab** course studied at [The German University in Cairo](https://www.guc.edu.eg/) in the *fourth* year of **Computer Science and Engineering bachelor degree**, and the following are the **Project Objectives**:
- Handle all aspects of web development projects, and greatly expanding our career opportunities by using MERN stack.
- Learn how to properly use the Agile Methodology to plan out a project and develop
the software.
- Learn the process of following a given set of System Requirements to develop a
software.
- Learn how to work together as a team on GitHub.

## Code Style
### All languages
* Following Single-responsibility principle
* Single quotes are preferred over double. Reason: HTML uses double quotes.
* Use `void 0` instead of `undefined`, because `undefined` could have been
redefined.
* Write code in functional style with minimum side effects.
* Don't use function statements. Instead, create anonymous functions and
assing them to vars for consistency with other vars.
### Git
* Keep your repository clean. Don’t commit big files unless they absolutely
  require git. Even in this case, prefer storing all big files in a separate
  submodule. That’s because git history can become very big and it will be pain
  for others to use the repo.
* Commit message:
    *  Capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation   
    * Complte the sentence "This commit will"
* Branch naming:
    * Use slashes as word separator.
    * Use namespaces, for example,
        * `[ContributerName]/[SprintNumber]/Feature/[FeatureName]` or
        * `[ContributerName]/[SprintNumber]/Bug/[BugFixed]`
        * like:  `Ragaa/Sprint2/Feature/Quiz`

## Framework used
The project is implemented using the MERN Stack, a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications, MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

- [Mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) is an open-source NoSQL cross-platform document-oriented database.
- [Express JS](https://expressjs.com/) is a web-based application framework work with Node JS, It helps to build web apps and RESTful APIs.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. React is a User Interface (UI) library. React is a tool for building UI components.
- [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a free JavaScript run-time environment, It executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is available for macOS, Windows, Linux, and Unix.
